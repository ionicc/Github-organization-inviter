# Github Organization Inviter

**Automate the addition of users to your organization** by hosting a web-app to allow people to click and recieve invitation to your Github Organization.

> This should've been an inbuilt feature of Github :triumph:

## How to use:

1) Get your [Github access token](https://github.blog/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/) and the name of your organization you want to generate the Inviter for.

2) Enter both of these variables and start the node server.

3) (Optional) Deploy it as a DigitalOcean droplet with Pm2 and Nginx.

## Is it being used anywhere?

Yes! This is being used in [join.codezoned.com](http://join.codezoned.com/).

**Make sure to read on Github access rate limit before deploying this app.**

## Can I use this?

Absolutely! Just sneak the credits in somewhere :smile:. 

Have fun making processes automate in your org or event!
